## Form Factor

The thumb cluster is designed for 1.5u, 1.25u, 1u keycaps
and the inner column for two 1.25u keycaps.
However the spacing allows for a few additional variations.

## PCB

The reversible PCB is based on Pro Micro compatible daughterboard
and has both MX and Khail Choc switch footprints.
It does not support hotwap sockets, LEDs, nor displays,
but does have battery pads and power switch pads for wireless builds.
Diodes and resistors are surface mount, respectively `SOD-123` and `1206` form-factors.
